                            <h3 class="heading-red">What is an HRV?</h3>
                            <p>
                                A Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) is a cutting-edge ventilation system designed to
                                improve air circulation while optimizing energy efficiency. HRVs are particularly
                                beneficial in climates with extreme temperatures, like those experienced in Winnipeg,
                                Manitoba. They work by exchanging stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air, all while
                                recovering and preserving the energy used for heating or cooling.
                            </p>
